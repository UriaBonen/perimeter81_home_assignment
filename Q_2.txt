At my last company, Deep Instinct, I was part of a team tasked with building automation infrastructure for a new product.
The challenge was that the existing automation framework already served several products, and integrating the new one without breaking anything was complex.
We debated whether to invest the effort to extend the existing framework or build a new one from scratch.
I believed it was worth trying to reuse the current infrastructure, but I wasn't sure how much time and work it would require—or what hidden issues might arise later.

After a few discussions, I proposed we start writing basic test cases as if the infrastructure already supported the new product. This allowed us to identify the gaps and assess the effort involved.
After about a month of work by a three-person team, we successfully added support for the new product within the existing framework.
I believe this is a solid approach, especially when facing uncertainty—it helps drive decisions through experimentation and concrete results.
